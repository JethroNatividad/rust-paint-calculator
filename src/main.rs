// Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a
// room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one
// gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons
// needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number

// Remember, you canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must
// round up to the next whole gallon.

// n of gallons to paint the ceiling of lxw room, where a gallon covers 350 sqft, round up the gallon.

// Inputs: Length, Width
// Process: ceiling sqft = lxw, gallons = round_up(ceiling sqft / gallon sqft).
// Output: You will need to purchase {n} gallon/s of paint to cover {ceiling sqft} square feet.
